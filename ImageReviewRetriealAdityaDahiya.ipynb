I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5\" away.  It did take some \"oomph\" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.

The finish is very well done. It's got a warm and full sound to it that I really enjoyed, that at times I found myself reluctant to stop playing. And I was really pleased with how smooth the fretting was, it felt like it took less effort to move between the frets and press down than on several guitars I've played on previously.\\n\\nThe only gripe I have is that the fret position markers (dots) are really dark and hard to spot (see pictures). But that's not a deal breaker by any means, since when playing you would normally look at the markers on the side of the neck, which were pretty clear. Still, aesthetically the dark markers don't look as nice.\\n\\nBut overall I was quite impressed, especially for such a great price.

The DW's onboard spurs are about where the ball of the foot goes, so with the pedal jumping, even when extended all the way down, the pedal still moved (hopped?) forward.  I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!  Pleasantly surprised at how heavy-duty and large it is.  If your slave pedal has a hoop clamp on it, you're ready to go right out of the package.  The spikes also can be reversed with rubber tips for hard surfaces.  I don't really need that feature as my rug goes with me to gigs.\"},\n",

I was pleasantly surprised to see the one thing I disliked about mine had been changed. The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.\\nThe stalk mount is now round, allowing for a near tight fit, without any wobble. The mount itself appears to be a thicker casting, as well as a sliding bar style clamp system allowing for a more tighter and secure hold on your desk. I am super pleased with this arm, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great budget boom arm.'},\n",

Now it's all together and very snug. Other than that it was an easy paint-by-number set up. The initial sound is great. I'll have to tweak cymbal #3 - (ride) it seems a bit quiet when I hit it.

The grey SG style is a small guitar, so there is extra room top to bottom and side to side, but with the neck strap, it doesn't slide around too much, and I would still feel comfortable using this bag with the SG.

I was mad for about 10 seconds. Great quality strap, looks fantastic, feels great to the hand and the locks are nothing to sneeze at, they really lock to your pins. So, I took it and put it on my Ibanez AS93 (a fairly heavy guitar for being semi-hollow) and they fit, perfectly. I had just done a string change and spent a little over an hour playing and breaking the strings in, this strap is super comfy (especially for not being padded). The material is somewhere between satin and a seatbelt with a cool stitched \"xxx/diamond\" design (that\\'s my words, not Planet Waves). Absolutely love it and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND for use with any guitar that doesn\\'t have recessed strap pins) A++++++'},\n",

I tested several guitars because I wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids I remember from the Martin coffee house days. I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. I bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. This cedar top has a magic to it and I am pleased with this one. Just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.\"},\n",

Imagine I could play electric guitar in my car, how portable is this thing! The bad thing about this is that the box packaging looks cheap and printing was bad.

They are made if ABS plastic and at the point where the arms swivel it's just a rivet the holds them together.

I have plugged a variety of pedals into the JP-02 and all powered-up as expected.  The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn\\'t seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.

I'm hoping that it will get better with repeated turning.it still is an awesome deal with the amp and other stuff its a pretty sweet sounding guitar especially for what you pay for it.\"},\n",

That being said when I recieved this RE 320 I was blown away.  I have done my radio show with it exclusively for the past 8 months and love it!  This mic ROCKS!  This microphone has XLR connections so be sure to use good mixer with those standard connections for a top quality mic like this.  When you first get this microphone you immediately notice the professional look and feel to it.  It is all that you would imagine it to be. Simply put this mic is top quality and produces great sound even without processing.  5 STARS!'},\n",

It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\"},\n",

As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things. Fun to play and lightweight. Recommended.\"},\n",

She was using a $100 Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid and *hated* it so I decided to fix that situation. With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\"},\n",

I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu.

Some felt like works of art, flashy, shiny, with that dipped in plastic look and feel. The Jim Dandy looked old style with jumbo fret markers, and a satin type finish...I thought it was old! I strummed a few chords and it played ok. I liked the short size and bought a back pack style case. I ride my bike two miles with my guitar every day to jam with friends at the Marina. This Gretsch Jim Dandy kicks mine and everyone that hears or plays it's butt! It stays in tune and the sound it puts out, tho not too loud, is pure nostalgia at it's finest! She cries the blues, yet if you finger pick a happy tune, you can't stop from smiling. This may not be an expensive instrument, but it's a true classic.\"},\n",

I currently own 2 other Dean guitars including a 12 string and I wanted to say that I bought this guitar based upon the reviews here on Amazon which I most often do. I have to admit I really like Dean humbuckers. This guitar did not disappoint.  It is beautiful, and that shiny chrome-like green neck with silver fret bars is awesome.  This guitar is VERY playable--fits well in my hands and has nice low action. I really like the sound it puts out and it DOES stay in tune contrary to the negative comments I read to the contrary.  I really like these tuners because they a precise. It sounds awesome through my Zoom G5 effects pedal. I agree with the reviewer who said 'buy it now'.  You won't  be sorry.  This is now my main squeeze especially for anything rock. I recorded 4 Iron Maiden songs with it.  Sweet!!!!!!!!  I love this guitar. I just love it.  I can't say that enough.\"},\n",

It was cut towards one end and as I unrolled it, a shower of the black mushroom nubs came falling out (see picture). Hmm...maybe just a bad roll. I opened the second one. This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal. I'm sure it would work fine, if you don't move things around, but just the idea that I can't do it do often doesn't sit well. Oh well, expensive lesson learned. Get the 3M instead. I have used it in the past. Good stuff.\"},\n",

I have a TS9DX and TS9 that were made for Ibanez by Maxon in the 90\\'s that were modded to 808 spec, and this pedal sounds dead-on to that sound.\\n\\nThe sound has been kind of a blanket statement of \"transparent light to medium drive\". Like any Tube Screamer, this has a great drive on its own, can push an overdriven amp without adding color, and can stack well with other pedals. It\\'s definitely a smoother overdrive than other Tube Screamers or clones I have.\\n\\nThe pedal I\\'d compare this to the most would be the Ibanez TS808, obviously. The sounds of the 2 pedals are very similar, but the OD808 is a little smaller, has a normal stompswitch, and costs a little less than the TS808 Reissue. This is definitely the real deal by the company that\\'s been making Tube Screamers longer than anyone else.

Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\"},\n",

It also only came with 2 screws instead of the 4 needed. I had the four screws that came with the guitar anyway, from the plastic jack plate I was replacing, so that was no problem either. The screws were a bit bigger than the intended screws so it gave it a bit more of an industrial look that was unintentional but I think it looks good nonetheless.

It doesnt bother me because I play metal and this sound doesnt come through the amp. But for you clean players, this heavy clunk might be audible through your amp. However, I would still give it a shot and see if you like it and can even hear it because it looks great and everyone hears their music differently! And I actually like the added chunky feel.

I left the strings that came with it on,and after they quit stretching(like any set of strings will do)it stays perfectly tuned. I will be buying more to start a good collection and would highly recommend this to a friend. It is a keeper for sure!!\\n__________________________________________________________\\n\\nThis is the review I gave some months back. I thought I would give an update.\\nSince purchasing this guitar,I have also purchased a Rondo SX,Hadean Tele,Epiphone Les Paul, Huntington Tele, Davison strat and an Oscar Schmidt Les Paul. I play in an old 60's style band and use my Crescent on stage. It's light,it stays in tune and the action I set perfect and the neck is comfortable and fast. I love playing my other guitars,but this Crescent is my workhorse. Ya gotta buy one.\"},\n",

Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great.

              "  'Review': \"I just wanted to say that the Fender Vintage Noiseless Pickups were a great upgrade to my 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster.  They provide a much cleaner, bell-like tone compared to the factory-fitted pickups.  The factory pickups are actually great for gritty blues and rock, but my playing is mostly clean, so I prefer the sound of the Vintage Noiseless.  Also, the package I got had the updated wiring diagram (correct!) - the only issue is that is didn't show how to connect the output jack hot wire, but it is shown on the wiring diagram from Fender's website (for the American Deluxe Stratocaster).  I installed the new pots, capacitors, resistor that came in the package and this gave me the cleanest, brightest tone.  If you want a warmer tone, you can probably skip doing this.\"},\n",

Didn't have to drill the tuner holes, they were the perfect size. Placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole (with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them) and  very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points. Then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch I made a center punch mark (just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft) on each indent that the tuner made. Set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than 15 minutes.\"},\n",

I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own. It would be nice if they had included some application recommendations for basic settings,\"},\n",

I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\"},\n",

I bought this case new from GC less than a year ago, have never had it out of my studio, and the handle molding over ball joint is crumbling and falling apart (see photo).  This is not due to abuse, climate or bad design ... it's junk plastic.  Too bad - the fit and finish of this case is perfect for my Gibson Les Paul R8 VOS. I love the design and light weight, but there's no way I'd risk carrying my guitar in it now.  The handle is going to fail at any moment.\\n\\nUPDATE 19 Feb 2015: I contacted SKB through their website about the handle issue.  They promptly shipped me a replacement handle, with new mounts and instructions. Hopefully the materials problem has been resolved in this replacement part. I really appreciate the follow-through from SKB and added a star to this review for that.\"},\n",

I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret.

Provides 10 power outputs, it is able to work for a standard pedalboard. But the price is not so expensive as the Voodoo Lab or T-Rex, etc, you can easily have a power supply to work for your own pedals. I am quite satisfied with the price and stability overall it is very worth having. NO HUM! EXCELLENT POWER! GET ONE!'},\n",

Originally, I had issues with it.  The sound was muffled and flat.  To correct it, I reinstalled the stylus until it clicked onto the front.  Sounds great now.\\n\\nI have it installed with the standard Technics alignment using the 52mm gauge.  It plays well setup like this on my SL-23 and sounds best to me over other alignments.  It seems to be sensitive to the VTA(rake) of the stylus.  With the standard mat, the angle was lower at the front.  Adding a 2nd mat raised the front higher and it made a huge difference.  Well worth the work.  Check the manual located at http://www.sumikoaudio.net/ContentsFiles/oys_oyster(4).pdf for other adjustments.'},\n",

Even then sometimes E1 would come loose.  A friend told me about string ties and suggested they might solve the problem. I looked around at the various tie systems available and I bought the Diamond Secure Classical Guitar String Ties because I liked the size. The result was what I needed; B and E1 don't slip with the ties and they stay in tune. I did a double loop with E1 as suggested in the instructions, just to be sure. I was concerned about the appearance of the Ties, but I am satisfied with the look. The Ties are small and have an unobtrusive,  neat appearance.  The attached picture shows my first effort with the Ties. In terms of sound or effect on the guitar I don't hear any difference, but the Ties do simplify the process of tying on strings.\"},\n",

Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button.

On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.  This case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  Plus, it looks classy.  I\\'m glad I bought it.'},\n",

It is essentially an embroidery hoop with black pantyhose, an adjustable arm and screw clamp. Building one yourself will probably run you over twenty dollars and you will end up with an interesting mixture of distracting textures and colors, so why not just buy it instead? Functionally it works fine. It does muffle sound to some extent when stacked up against a metal mesh screen but for anything short of an audience of 50,000, it should appease just fine. all in all, if you are hitting annoying pops in your recording and don't want to spend a lot of money -- this is the way to go.\"},\n",

With this having the functionality of a stompbox you'd want to mount it within your first line of pedals on your board for ease of switching, but the amount of cables running at the back takes up needed space if your pedal board is small .

Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.

So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.  Very nice and yes I would buy them again.\"},\n",

For a long time the tuner just sat in my room, but recently I started taking the tuner around to practice and transporting it in my bag. Unfortunately one of the 3 plastic pieces where the gooseneck attaches to the tuner broke off. It still works but the head sometimes falls off of the tuner. Now I'm looking for a clip on tuner that is a little more durable. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.\\n\\nI've added a photo that shows where one of the plastic pieces is missing (so you can see the joint)\"},\n",

If you turn on an effect  (one push is chorus, another push takes you to delay, one more push is reverb), the intensity of the effect is controlled by these settings (green the lowest amount of effect, red the highest).

The center mike holder opening is for a much larger microphone than the ATR 2100, that I own.

After researching a replacement in the same price range, I found none. I had some foam pipe insulation for 1/2 inch pvc pipe in the utility room. This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn\\'t seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo.

But it was packaged well and already assembled, so I was pretty happy. Once I had it installed on my rack, I noticed the cable holes in the back aren't even punched out! The main reason I bought this was to store my noisy external hard drive.  I can't do that now, so I guess this drawer is just going to hold random crap that I have on my desk.  I'm honestly pretty bummed. I was tempted to give this two stars, but the drawer itself is pretty acceptable for the price. If you don't need to run cables through the back of it,  then I don't see any reason this wouldn't work for you.\"},\n",

The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts.

I read one review in which the guy was not satisfied because he said it sounded like \"80\\'s glam rock.\" I totally disagree. If you can play and have a decent amp - you can get a variety of great sounds out of this little box. It seems like so many players like a fuzzy, buzzy type overdrive sound. I prefer a thicker creamy sound and you can dial that up with this pedal. For a mere $35, I was willing to roll the dice - I found a diamond in the rough.'},\n",

So, you need to glue the covers on so the weight of the pickup doesn't pull loose and fall into the cavity over time. I used clear epoxy and, hoping for the best since I sold the bass when it was finished. On a positive note, the screws and springs were included which was very nice.\\n2. The covers have sharper corners than standard precision bass pickups so, if you use a template to route cavities,  you'll probably have to go back and chisel the corners like I did.\\nIm not a fan of that since it doesn't look as professional but, I was using a chrome pickup cover so, it worked out.\\nThe owner of the bass can't say enough about their sound and, I would buy them again.\"},\n",
